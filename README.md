# Character Generator
This web-app generates a new 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons character. The race and class are randomized, and the stats are determined by programatically rolling four d6 and dropping the lowest value. If the generated character doesn't have at least two stats 14 or higher and the combined total of all stats isn't at least 70, a new set of stats is rolled.
